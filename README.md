# pacmanexercise
## MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN - January 2021
### Check out the iconic PacMan in action through this fun project! 
#### This repository was crafted to showcase the solution for the coding assignment in Week 7. This is a webpage that showcase PacMen. This project can be viewed via https://megnieves.github.io/pacmanexercise/ As of now there are no future plans to edit and/or add to this project. 
#####  Within this repository are files necessary to manipulate the movements of PacMen across the screen. After I was done with this project I learned how to successfully create PacMen with a click of a button and allow them to move at their own pace.
